# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I am a Machine Learning Scientist at AI VIVO and a Data Scientist at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. My work is at the intersection of computational biology and drug discovery, where I develop deep generative and foundation models for molecules and cells. I specialize in molecule generation and single-cell perturbation modeling using advanced techniques like VAEs, Diffusions, Transformers, and Flow Matchings. I'm passionate about building AI methods that accelerate target discovery and therapeutic design.
