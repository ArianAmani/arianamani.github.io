abstract: "CellDISECT (Cell DISentangled Experts for Covariate counTerfactuals) is a powerful causal generative model that enhances single-cell analysis by disentangling variations to separate covariate variations at test time, learning to make accurate counterfactual predictions, achieving flexible fairness through expert models for each latent space, and capturing both covariate-specific information and novel biological insights. *These authors contributed equally."
